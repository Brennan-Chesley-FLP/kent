"""PageElement protocol for unified data extraction across drivers.

This module provides a driver-agnostic interface for querying HTML elements,
extracting text and attributes, and navigating the DOM. PageElement is always
backed by static parsed HTML (LXML). The driver is responsible for obtaining
the HTML, whether via HTTP or by serializing a rendered Playwright DOM.
